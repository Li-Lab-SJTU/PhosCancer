# PhosCancer
PhosCancer is a comprehensive database for extracting biologically and clinically relevant insights from phosphoproteomics data from the Chinese Human Proteome Project (CNHPP) and the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC). Currently, PhosCancer encompasses 174,587 unique phosphosites from 14 datasets spanning 12 cancer types. Each phosphosite is linked to detailed annotations across seven categories: (i) Basic Information, (ii) 3D Structure, (iii) Functional Domains, (iv) Upstream Kinases, (v) Associations with Clinical Features, (vi) Relevance with Hallmarks, and (vii) Pan-Cancer View.

Code added is directly from the web server. Efforts to modularize the code are currently being done and functions that can be easily used by the public will be released soon.
