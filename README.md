# PhosCancer
PhosCancer (<https://lilab.life.sjtu.edu.cn/PhosCancer>) is a comprehensive database for extracting biologically and clinically relevant insights from phosphoproteomics data from the Chinese Human Proteome Project (CNHPP) and the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC). Currently, PhosCancer encompasses 174,587 unique phosphosites from 14 datasets spanning 12 cancer types. Each phosphosite is linked to detailed annotations across seven categories: **(i) Basic Information, (ii) 3D Structure, (iii) Functional Domains, (iv) Upstream Kinases, (v) Associations with Clinical Features, (vi) Relevance with Hallmarks, and (vii) Pan-Cancer View.**
  
Here, you will find code for data preprocessing, filtering, imputation, analysis, and figure generation. The repository includes:
-  Basic Information
-  3D Structure
-  Functional Domains
-  Upstream Kinases
-  Associations with Clinical Features
-  Relevance with Hallmarks
-  Pan-Cancer View
